# Portfolio Website

Website to display my UX design, coding, art, and animation work. I'm continuously updating this site to improve its functionality and showcase my most recent projects.

**Demo:** [jacqkirkman.com](https://jacqkirkman.com/)

## How It's Made

**Tech Used:** React, Framer Motion, MUI 

My previous portfolio website was made with Carrd.co. As I started my career shift into tech, I decided to rebuild my website from the ground up. It served as both a coding practice and a platform to display my work. I created some basic wireframes in Figma as a guide and used Create React App as the foundation for this project. I deployed it using Cloudflare Pages.

## Lessons Learned:

In my ongoing quest to bridge my animation background with my current coding journey, I put extra emphasis on adding dynamic transitions and movement to this project. 

I was inspired by the scroll button on [Parker Kuncl's portfolio](https://www.parkerkuncl.com/) and wanted to achieve something similar. As a result, I gained the following key takeaways:

* Understanding of animation libraries like Framer Motion.
* Improved proficiency in React and React hooks, such as `useRef`.
